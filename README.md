# mouanga-chess
the worst chess library ever made. expect bugs, the king taking his own pieces and other fun stuff. this is not chess; in fact, it is an insult to chess and everything it stands for. nothing works. i feel sorry for whoever has to make a gui for this pile of garbage. if you are the fortunate one assigned with such a task, all i can say is good luck, you'll need it. no but like seriously, it's like a child made this code. a cat walking on the keyboard would produce better work. a monkey flinging his poop at the keyboard would probably write a better library than this, this project is the equivalent of a flaming bag of feces. the code contained within this repository is of so low quality that it is directly harmful to human eyes and to the human psyche, comparable to chernobyl but for your eyes. seriously. run away now, this is your final warning.
