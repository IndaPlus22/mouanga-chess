# mouanga-chess
the worst chess library ever made. expect bugs, the king taking his own pieces and other fun stuff. this is not chess; in fact, it is an insult to chess and everything it stands for. nothing works. i feel sorry for whoever has to make a gui for this pile of garbage. if you are the fortunate one assigned with such a task, all i can say is good luck, you'll need it. no but like seriously, it's like a child made this code. a cat walking on the keyboard would produce better work. a monkey flinging his poop at the keyboard would probably write a better library than this, this project is the equivalent of a flaming bag of feces. the code contained within this repository is of so low quality that it is directly (and intensely) harmful to human eyes and to the human psyche, comparable to chernobyl but for your eyes. seriously. i suggest you run away as far as you can from this repository, and try to forget it even exists. if you have already been exposed to any part of this source code, you will most likely go insane within 72 hours. it was nice knowing you.
